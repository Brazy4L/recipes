    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <p>Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a <strong>brilliant</strong> idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.</p>
    <p>I told him if he helped me make it I would talk about him on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get his attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" but he loved picking his own toppings, and the finished product was <em>"awesome"</em>.</p>
