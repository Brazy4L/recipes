    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <div><p>When a hot and bubbly baking dish filled with homemade lasagna hits the dinner table, it's guaranteed to disappear fast! Multiple layers of noodles, cheese, and sauce are the <strong>best</strong> kind of edible architecture. I like to treat my Italian family with this comfort food because it always brings smiles at the end of a long day.</p>
    <p>Using convenient pantry staples makes preparation easy, while effortlessly bumping up the flavor of the meat sauce and cheese layers. Ripe canned tomatoes and dried herbs help to instantly boost the flavor. If you're in a pinch for time, make the layers in advance and bake when you're ready to serve, <em>it's a game-changer!</em></p></div>
